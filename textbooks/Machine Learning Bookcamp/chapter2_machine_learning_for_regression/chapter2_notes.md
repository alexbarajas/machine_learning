# 2 Machine learning for regression

## 2.1. Car-price prediction project

The problem we solve in this chapter is predicting the price of a car.

Before we can train any model, we need to know what kind of data we have and whether is it useful.

We look at the dataset to learn:

- The distributino of the target variable
- The features in this dataset
- The distribution of values in these features
- The quality of the data
- The number of missing values

### 2.2.3 Target variable analysis

It's generally good when the target distribution looks like the normal distribution (bell curve). Under this condition, models such as linear regression perform well.

### 2.2.5. Validation framework

It's good to split the dataset into three parts: train, validation, and test.

A way to split the DataFram is 20% of the data goes to validation, 20% goes to test, and the remaining 60% goes to train.

### 2.3.1. Linear regression

The dot product is a wwy of multiplying two vectors
